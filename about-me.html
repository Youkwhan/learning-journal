						Hi there! My name is You Kwhan and welcome to my learning journal.

						After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career
						Path, I've made the big jump to embark on a new journey as a
						self-taught developer. Join me as I share my experiences, insights,
						and lessons learned along the way in this exciting new chapter of my
						web development journey.

					How I stay committed to learning
				</h3>
				<p class="section__preview section__preview--read">
					I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
					and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
					learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
				</p>
				<p class="section__preview section__preview--read">
					While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
					was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
				</p>
				<h3 class="section__preview section__preview--title">
					How I got started
				</h3>
				<p class="section__preview section__preview--read">
					I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
					take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
					use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
					short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
				</p>
				<p class="section__preview section__preview--read">
					That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
					my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
					motivated.

						these algorithms.
